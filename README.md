# Description
Welcome! These are the homeworks that I made for my Machine Learning course (Apre @IST) class in the year academic year 2023/2024. 

They were four in total, and each had a **"Pen-and-paper"** chapter, 
that I solved by hand on One Note, involving hand calculations and concepts, and a **Programming** chapter, solved on Jupyter Notebook.

Their topics are:

- **Decision Trees and Evaluation** (HW1)
- **Bayesian and Lazy Learning** (HW2)
- **Neural Networks and Regression** (HW3)
- **Clustering and PCA** (HW4)
